# Linked-List-Stack-CPP
 Own implementation of a linked list stack in C++.
 
 This is my manual implementation of a linked list stack.
 This stack is abstract and is templated. 
 It performs various functions such as string reversal and Pre/Postfix conversion.
 
 Note:
 Postfix conversion is not perfect and some use cases will not work.
